# Blender-ASCII-Grid-Import
Import of ASCII Grid Files (.asc) for Blender

This Blender add-on imports ASCII Grid Files (ESRI) into Blender. To install, go to Blender's User Preferences and run the "Install from Fileâ€¦" command.
After installing the script, Blender's import menu will be added an item called "ASCII Grid (.asc)". You will then be prompted to import the data.

Now supports change the reprojection settings by using byproj if available.
